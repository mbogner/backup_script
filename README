This project simply provides some functions to backup databases, files and folders. Default location is /home/backup. For simple configuration all functions are separated from the functions and a configuration file is loaded from /etc/backup.conf. This holds all overridden parameters and configuration. The backup_local.sh is executed after loading the configuration. A sample backup_local.sh is found in backup.sh. You should not change backup.sh or backup_functions.sh locally to be able to update the script. backup.conf and backup_local.sh are in .gitignore so you are able to place all files in the same folder as the script and just place a softlink to /etc.
